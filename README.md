<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Pepper is a humanoid robot developed by SoftBank, currently there is a Pepper robot purchased residing in the UniSA Elizabeth Health and Medical Clinic. UniSA Elizabeth Health and Medical clinic had an aim to be able to utilize Pepper to assist in their speech pathology therapy sessions.

This project was formed to develop a working application that can run on Pepper that can assist clinicians to conduct an interesting and interactive speech pathology therapy session for the patients.

The application consists of two parts, the first part is the application interface to be displayed on the Pepper Robot tablet screen, the second part is the robot choreography connected corresponding to the interface that controls the robot actions to conduct accordingly while the program is running.
